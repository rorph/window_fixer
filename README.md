# Window Fixer

This is a small collection of scripts intended to save and restore window positions on windows 7+.

On a multi screen envoriment it's highly annoying when display port simply unplugs the screen and rearrange the whole desktop, also when you play games and resolution changes, messing up windows.

I'm using a AutoHotKey macro to save and restore window position, there's a bonus that's a macro to force screens to go on power save mode and save positions.

You might wanna look into the .ahk , vars.php and .bat files changing them to your correct paths.

You will need cmdow - https://github.com/rorph/window_fixer.git

I couldn't care less to code this on a friendly way, but I mean, it works!

Enjoy!
